# HandWritten-Word-drawn-Segmentation-up-to-character-Level
A Matlab Code for Word Segmentation upto Character Level

A character is the smallest unit of any language script and the segmentation of characters is the most crucial step for any OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System. This system translates scanned or printed image of the document into a text document that can be edited.
Character segmentation has been an active field of research for many years. It still remains an open problem in the field of pattern recognition and image processing. There are mainly two phases of a character segmentation system namely preprocessing, segmentation.
